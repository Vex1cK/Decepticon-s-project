# HowBurrBot

HowBurrBot is a Transformer-based neural network designed to detect rhotacism (non-standard pronunciation of the 'r' sound) in audio files. The neural network is wrapped in a Telegram bot. Users can send voice messages to the bot, which then predicts whether the sender has rhotacism.

## Features

- **State-of-the-art Speech Recognition**: Utilizes a Transformer neural network for accurate detection of rhotacism.
- **Easy to Use**: Simply send a voice message to the Telegram bot (@howburrbot) and receive a prediction.
- **Real-time Processing**: Quick response times for analyzing audio files.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vex1cK/Decepticon-s-project
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Set up your Telegram bot:**
    - Create a new bot on Telegram by talking to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
    - Copy the bot token and paste it into the `.env` file. You should to create it firstly next to `oxr.py`

4. **Run the bot:**
    ```bash
    python OMGITSOURBOT.py
    ```

## Usage

Once the bot is running, you can interact with it on Telegram:

1. Open your Telegram bot.
2. Send a voice message to the bot.
3. Receive a prediction on whether the sender has rhotacism.
